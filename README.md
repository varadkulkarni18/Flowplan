# Flowplan
FlowPlan - A smart daily planner which will help you schedule your tasks and accomplish your daily goals .

A Front-end technology based project that does the simple task management and scheduling for the productive people.

This dummy smart daily planner was presented by me in the " Front-end Battle 2.0 " comptetition organised by IIT Bhubaneshwar where 4 hours were given to create an beautiful webpage using the assets and refernces provided by them .
Had a great time develping this project . we were also allowed to make use of the AI tools and design elements and had a very nice experience competing with thousands of participants in this online event. 
Although not selected for the 2nd round yet received a participation certificate from IIT Bhubaneshwar and a great experience also.
